# Cursor AI Project Rules

# 🧠 Purpose
# Apply to all files in this project automatically.
# These are like persistent system instructions.

rules:
- "Always include clear comments and docstrings."
- "Use safe patterns (no eval, no exec)."
- "When writing utilities, include helper functions and explain each step."
- "When I select text with '# AI INSTRUCTION' comments at the top, use them as task context. Do not touch, edit or delete those texts."
- "Follow Matteo's preferred code style: clear section headers, no unnecessary abstractions."
