# ===============================================
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
# -----------------------------------------------
# ðŸ“˜ Purpose:
#   Run Ruff (lint) and Black (format) locally
#   BEFORE commits land in git. Dev sees & fixes
#   issues immediately; CI only double-checks.
#
# ðŸ§© Hooks included:
#   - ruff (lint, with autofix)
#   - black (format)
#
# ðŸ§  Tips:
#   - First commit may reformat many files.
#   - Review diffs, learn the rules, commit again.
